# PROJECT 3 | Data Cleaning

Felicia/Ferdi/Natan
  
## Steps

- Load the file into Python using Pandas 
- Looking at the raw data using panda basic functions
- Using various data cleaning methods to fill missing values whilst respecting data
  integrity
- Export the clean data frame to SQL using a connect module in Python
- Visualize tables and write queries to extract meaningful information

## Our Results

  From this data, where artists and members of the entertainment industry were vastly represented, we found that the gender gap was not as prevalent as one might initially expect. Women took the lead in engineering or homemaking jobs, but are unfortunately still vastly under represented in senior positions such as executive jobs or entertainment.
  
  We have further finding in our presentation.

## Challenges

  -Filling missing data whilst maintaining data integrity
  -Write relevant queries

## Deliverables

- `main.ipynb` with your responses.
- readme file with your summary
