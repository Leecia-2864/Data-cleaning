# PROJECT 3 | Data Cleaning

Felicia/Ferdi/Natan

## Project Description

The challenge of this week was to apply various methods learnt about how to structure and reorganize imported raw data with the pandas python library. Organizing data in a dataframe, manipulating the columns/rows of the table, grouping by certain values and aggregating further columns, dataframe calculations such as sum, mean etc. are just some of the different skills we used while working on this project. Furthermore we then put into action these skills to turn our raw data into usable data by apllying key steps of data cleaning such as dealing with NaN values, checking for outliers etc.
The result of our work is a databse containing our cleaned data and multiple queries in which we analyze different corrolations bewteen the data.


## Workflow

- Load the file into Python using Pandas 
- Examine the raw data using panda basic functions
- Using various data cleaning methods to fill missing values whilst respecting data
  integrity
- Checking unique values of columns to look for outliers or other incorrect data and replace these with corrected versions
- Export the clean data frame to SQL using a connect module in Python
- Visualize tables and write queries to extract meaningful information

## Organization
- Planning on Trello
- Setting up our github repository
- Worked simoultaniously on different jupyter notebooks and discussed about methods to apply


## Our Results
We have developed queries focusing on following matters:
- gender disparity in professions
- graduate status in professions
- corolation between avg. family size and avg. spending score of professions
  

## Challenges

  - Filling missing data whilst maintaining data integrity
  - deciding on relevant queries
